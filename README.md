**Phosphor Icons Viewer**

A simple, fast, and searchable web application to explore all icons from Flutter's phosphor_flutter package. This tool was created to provide an easy-to-use visual reference, which was previously unavailable.

â€¢	Infinite Scrolling: Icons are loaded efficiently as you scroll, ensuring a smooth experience even with a massive dataset.

â€¢	Click to Copy: Simply click on any icon to copy its Flutter ID (e.g., atom) directly to your clipboard.

â€¢	Built with Flutter Web: Demonstrates the power of Flutter for building fast and beautiful web applications.

â€¢	Fully Responsive: Looks and works great on both desktop and mobile browsers.



ðŸš€ **Motivation**

While Microsoft's Phosphor icons are a fantastic alternative to Material Icons, there wasn't a dedicated, user-friendly web viewer available to quickly search and reference them for Flutter development. 

This project aims to fill that gap by providing a one-stop solution for developers to visually discover and utilize the entire phosphor_flutter library.


ðŸ’» **Tech Stack**

â€¢	Framework: Flutter (Web)

â€¢	Language: Dart

â€¢	Icon Library: phosphor_flutter


The output will be located in the build/web directory. You can then deploy this directory to any static web hosting service.
