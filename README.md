**Fluent Icons Viewer**

A simple, fast, and searchable web application to explore all icons from Flutter's fluentui_system_icons package. This tool was created to provide an easy-to-use visual reference, which was previously unavailable.

ðŸš€ **Motivation**

While Microsoft's Fluent UI icons are a fantastic alternative to Material Icons, there wasn't a dedicated, user-friendly web viewer available to quickly search and reference them for Flutter development. 

This project aims to fill that gap by providing a one-stop solution for developers to visually discover and utilize the entire fluentui_system_icons library.


ðŸ’» **Tech Stack**

â€¢	Framework: Flutter (Web)

â€¢	Language: Dart

â€¢	Icon Library: fluentui_system_icons


The output will be located in the build/web directory. You can then deploy this directory to any static web hosting service.
